# Personal Website

My personal website built with Next.js, featuring an About section with my background and career journey, and a Writing section for publishing articles and thoughts.

## What's Included

- **About Section** - Personal bio, career journey, and background
- **Writing Section** - Space for publishing articles and blog posts
- **Contact Footer** - Links to email, LinkedIn, and Substack

Built with a clean, minimal design using white background and black text, with content centered in the middle 2/3 of the page.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.
